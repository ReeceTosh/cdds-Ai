There is some unknown issue with visual studios that involve with opening the project where the assigned assets and scripts disappear from
where they are ment to be, so here is a list of prefabs and scripts that are in this project and what is assigned to it. Use this if this if the issue
occurs again. There is a chance that you may end up aswell that you will be in an empty scene so go to scene and select the scene named 'SampleScene'.

*Prefabs*

- Player (Script: PlayerAI.cs -> Fields: slider (HealthBar) /  Sprite image: Image prefabs -> Player)

- Enemy (Script: EnemyAI.cs / Sprite image: Image prefabs -> Enemy)

*In Heirachy* 

- Testing (Script: TestAstarClick.cs -> Fields: Enemy Prefab (Enemy), Player Prefab (Player)).
